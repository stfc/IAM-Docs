# Registering an Account

## Introduction
The IRIS IAM and SKA IAM provides an authentication and authorization service to a number of IRIS and SKA resources. 

The primary way of doing this is by **creating an account associated with a users home instiution identity ([eduGAIN](https://edugain.org/))**. By associating accounts with instiutional identities, it ensures that all members have an active affiliation with an IRIS or SKA partner at sign-in time.

Please note that all account requests require a member of the IAM admin team to approve them before they are activated. We endeavour to approve requests within **4 working hours** of recievining the request. Any requests made during the evening or over the weekend will likely see delays.

## Registration Process
