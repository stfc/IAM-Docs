# Groups and entitlements
The IRIS IAM/SKA IAM conveys authorization through your membership of relevant groups, which you will need to apply and then be subsequently accepted for before being able to access any corresponding resources. 

If you are applying after being given direction from a specific service, you should have been informed if you will require any group memberships.
