### 04 Feb 2025: **At-risk** for upgrade to INDIGO IAM v1.11.0
Please be aware of the following **At-risk** period:

- **SKA IAM: 18th Feb 2024 (Tuesday) from 8:30-9:30 AM (Europe/London)**
- **IRIS IAM: 5th March 2025 (Wednesday) from 8:30-9:30 AM (Europe/London)**

This will result in IAM operating at-risk during the stated period when we carry out essential updates for the IAM to version v1.11.0 to introduce multi factor authentication. The IAM may be unavailable during this time, though any tokens issued before the start of the at-risk period will remain active for their corresponding lifetime. 

We will let you know once all the work has been completed.
